// In Javascript every value is either an Object or a Primitive value (Type of a variable can be verified by typeof keyword)

// Note: typeof null is an object.

/************************************
 * Primitive Datatypes
 */

//  Number - Floating point numbers used for decimals & numbers;
let age = 25;
// String - Seequence of characters used for text; should be wrapped with quotes else js will think its a variable.
let firstName = 'Senthur';
// Boolean - can contain logical value (true/false);
let fullAge = true;
// Undefined - value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (Empty value)
let children;
// Null - Also means empty value,
// Symbol (ES2015) - Value that are unique and cannot be changed
// BigInt (ES2020) - Larger Integer than the Number type can hold

// Javascript has a feature called dynamic typing. when we create a new variable the type of the variable is determined by the value it is holding. we can change the variable value to different type of value anytime.
